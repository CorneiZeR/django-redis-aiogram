# Deployment

One container runs the bot. Every other process just queues messages.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  back:
    image: ${IMAGE}
    command: gunicorn core.wsgi:application -b 0:8000
    env_file: .env

  celery_worker:
    image: ${IMAGE}
    command: celery -A core worker -l info
    env_file: .env

  telegram_bot:
    image: ${IMAGE}
    command: python manage.py start_tgbot
    restart: always
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      DJANGO_REDIS_AIOGRAM_ENABLED: 1
    depends_on: [redis]

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    restart: always
```

Note what is **not** set: `back` and `celery_worker` leave `ENABLED` alone.
They queue messages, and `ENABLED=0` would make those calls no-ops — the
messages would vanish with a debug line and nothing else. The flag is for
processes that must not reach Telegram or Redis at all: image builds, a
migration container, CI. See below.

## What ENABLED=0 turns off

- no router autodiscovery, so those modules are never imported
- no system checks registered
- `send`, `send_redis` and `send_raw` become no-ops that build neither a bot
  nor a connection
- `start_tgbot` reports why and exits

A disabled process needs no token and no reachable Redis at all.

`ENABLED` is parsed rather than tested for truthiness — `'false'`, `'no'`,
`'off'` and `0` all disable the bot, and an unparseable value raises rather
than being read as enabled.

## The restart: always trap

A clean exit still counts as a crash under `restart: always`, so a disabled
`start_tgbot` would restart forever. Either keep the container out of the
default set:

```yaml
  telegram_bot:
    profiles: [bot]
```

or park it:

```yaml
    command: python manage.py start_tgbot --idle
```

`--idle` blocks until a signal instead of returning.

## Health and shutdown

`SIGTERM` unwinds cleanly: polling stops, the consumer thread is joined, the
aiogram session and FSM storage are closed. Give the container enough grace
period to finish an in-flight send:

```yaml
    stop_grace_period: 30s
```

## Is it working?

`docker ps` answers the wrong question: the process being up says nothing about
the consumer thread, which can be dead while polling continues.

```shell
python manage.py tgbot_healthcheck
```

Exit 0 and a line on stdout when healthy, non-zero with the reason on stderr
otherwise. It checks three things: Redis answers, the consumer reported in
recently, and the queue is not piling up.

The consumer writes `<REDIS_MESSAGES_KEY>:heartbeat:<worker>` every
`HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` seconds, with a TTL of three times that — so one missed
refresh is not a failure, but a dead thread stops looking alive on its own. The
key is per worker, named like the in-flight list, so each container answers for
itself.

```yaml
  telegram_bot:
    command: python manage.py start_tgbot
    healthcheck:
      test: ['CMD', 'python', 'manage.py', 'tgbot_healthcheck']
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      start_period: 30s
      retries: 3
```

`start_period` matters: the first heartbeat is written when the consumer's loop
first turns, so a container checked immediately after start has nothing to show
yet.

To fail when work is backing up rather than only when the worker is gone, set a
queue limit — as a setting, or per invocation:

```shell
python manage.py tgbot_healthcheck --max-queue 1000 --max-age 60
```

A disabled process is not unhealthy: with `ENABLED=0` the command says so and
exits 0, since nothing is meant to be running there.

## Scaling

One bot container is normally enough — Telegram's limits bind long before the
consumer does. Several are safe if you want the redundancy: the pop is atomic,
so a queued message goes to exactly one worker.

On Redis 6.2+ a message is moved to a per-worker processing list while it is
being sent, and a restarted worker reclaims what it left there — delivery is
**at-least-once**, so a crash mid-send can produce a duplicate. Older servers
lack `LMOVE` and fall back to plain pops, which is **at-most-once**: a kill
between the pop and the call loses that one message. A send that *fails* is
acknowledged and logged either way, never redelivered for ever. See
**[[Delivery]]**.

Do not run two containers polling the **same token**, though. Telegram allows
only one `getUpdates` consumer per bot, and the second will fight the first for
updates.

## Not using containers

Nothing here is docker-specific. Run `python manage.py start_tgbot` under
systemd or supervisor; the web and worker services need no extra environment,
since only one process should run `start_tgbot` in the first place.
